## Game Instructions
Blast away bit stealing enemies in this small action game made with python/pygame! Challenge your friends to achieve the highest score and survive to the end. 

Fire at enemies to score points and try to bring the decryptor to the Cyber Door to proceed to the next level. Collecting coin bits will give you points but will also go to the meter on the left which will restore your health. Watch out because you have limited amount of health shown by the green bar at the top. Your maximum health will increase as your coin meter fills up each time so make sure to get those coins! Also look out for different items especially weapons as they will be valuable upgrades to your arsenal!
